Masyu Solver
============

Displays Masyu puzzles at an HTTP endpoint.

This project was started as an exercise in learning the Go language. The idea was to write a
general purpose solver that could solve [Masyu puzzles](https://www.google.com/search?q=maysu+puzzle).

In the course of thinking about the problem, I realized that I wouldn't be able to satisfactorily
display the puzzles in the terminal, so I wrote some CSS code to go along with HTML output to
display the puzzle. So far, this is as far as I have gotten.

So the name is a bit of a misnomer at the moment.
